# PorYgon2
Discord bot originally created for /r/MysteryDungeon. Was the main bot of /r/Pokemon for four years.
Maintainers are myself and [SirThane](https://github.com/SirThane).
This bot is a representation of the growth of my python knowledge since 2015, and its current state has been a long time coming. Fair warning that some parts of the codebase may be a little rougher around the edges than others, though it has had a few rewrites over the years.

If you want to use some features from Porygon2 or reference it in some way, feel free! I learned a lot from looking at other bot code. I'd just ask that, if you make a new bot based on my code, you not name it Porygon, Porygon2, Porygon-Z, or something else along those lines. 
Also, I'd advise you to **not** use ! as a prefix. When I created my bot in 2015, there weren't many other conflicts, but now it's likely you're going to be rubbing shoulders and possibly conflicting with another bot. Get creative!

If you want to bring up a mirror of Porygon2, you will need a Redis database running, which will need to be pre-populated with some content for the bot to function properly per-cog. At some point, I intend to add some instructions/a utility script to populate the database.

For transparency, this repo is a mirror of the active development repository. It is manually updated every now and then with code from the main repository. It does make some omissions, though none that impede the overall functionality of the bot.
