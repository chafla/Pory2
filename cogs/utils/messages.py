By opting in to this role, you'll get access to rooms that might be a little more mature, and with that access comes responsibility.\n
Keep in mind that you're still under the same rules as usual, and that the more mature stuff stays in the mature rooms, and nowhere else.\n
\n
**Ultimately, this is a privilege, and since you're claiming maturity, if you don't show it, you might lose the role.**\n
Reply with `confirm` to receive the role.\n
If you want to remove the role, you can PM me `!unset18`.\n
