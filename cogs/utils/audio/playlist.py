"""
Playlist setup for the music player.

Procedure should be like this:
    - Connect to voice channel, initializing a new playlist which is saved per vc.
    - Wait on further action.
    - When a new song is queued up, create a new `Entry` object which contains the song info. Could even just be the dict.
    - Fetch stats first for the entry. After, create a future object that is tracked as an instance variable. The player
        will wait for this to proceed before playing the next song.
        - If another song is queued up while the current one is queueing/playing; create the object, try to download it
            in the background, and add it to the queue.
    - Play the song once it's ready, removing it from the queue and adding it to an instance var `current_song` as well
        as a `history` queue. The track should never be in the playing queue if it has been touched.
    - Proceed to the next one.
