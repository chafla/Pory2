Base cog for april fools shenanigans

Users can use !ban <@mention>, which gives the target a role with no read permissions in most channels.
It does, though, give users read access to a certain few channels that we can make.
Every user can only ban one other user.

TODO:
Change the actual mod role names, but keep track of their IDs
Consider a better way of implementing this that lets people participate

'Hey, everyone. It's been a long month or two, and us mods are honestly pretty drained from the past few weeks.
We've decided that we're going to take a day off. We've heard all your wishes about being mods yourselves, and so,
effective immediately, everyone has mod powers. You can use !ban <mention> to ban troublemakers for us, though you can
only use it once every few hours to be safe.

Thanks for the help, and we'll see you soon!'

******************

Was planned for afd 2017 shenanigans, but was shelved for another day.
